# DesignPattern-Projects
If we talk about The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) we said Design Patterns (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) 
Before designing any software, with any language, we have to know about the different design pattern.
It's very important to use them when we do our sofwtare design. 
Design pattern are best practices !
In this project, we will give some examples in C# to study how we can use them and in any case.
